# 📊 Financial Analysis using Power BI

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Finance teams often face challenges in understanding and communicating key financial metrics like revenue, expenses, and profitability. Without visual insights, it's hard to track performance trends or uncover areas of concern.

## ✅ Solution 

To solve this, I created a fully interactive dashboard using Power BI. It helps visualize and explore key financial data from 2013 and 2014. The dashboard was built from scratch using Excel as the data source.

Key insights and features include:

- **Total Sales, Profit, COGS, and Quantity Sold**
- **Top Products by Sales and Profit**
- **Sales by Segment** (e.g., Government, Midmarket)
- **Sales by Country** (United States, Canada, Mexico, etc.)
- **Monthly trends** across two years (2013 & 2014)
- Easy-to-use filters for Product, Year, and Month

This dashboard brings all the important numbers together in one place, helping teams quickly identify what’s working and where improvements can be made.

## 💼 Business Value

With this dashboard, decision-makers can:

- Spot the most profitable and best-selling products
- Compare financial performance between countries and segments
- Understand seasonal sales patterns
- Monitor cost and profit changes over time

It provides a clear and simple way to track business performance, making it easier to plan strategies based on real data.

## 📁 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** – For building and designing the dashboard
- **Microsoft Excel** – Used as the data source
